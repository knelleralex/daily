I am not at liberty to disclose all the details of the entire system, 
therefore I have created this short piece of SAS code just to demonstrate 
the basic idea at the core.
The real system obviously has error handling mechanisms, missing data handling,
various forms of encapsulation, OLAP reporting, statistical model for generating the costs
table, different formats to ensure data integrity, and more.

The objective is to show real time depiction of profitability of daily flights, 
in order to maintain close control over the business, in between monthly reports.
